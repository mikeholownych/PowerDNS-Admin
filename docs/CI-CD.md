# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This document describes the automated deployment pipeline used by **PowerDNS-Admin**.  Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/` and are executed by GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Architecture

```
.github/workflows/
  ci.yml              # Continuous integration testing matrix
  security.yml        # Security scanning and compliance checks
  deploy-staging.yml  # Blue–green deployment to staging
  deploy-production.yml # Blue–green deployment to production
  dependency-update.yml # Automated dependency updates
```

### Testing Strategy

The CI workflow runs on a matrix of:

- **Python**: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Databases**: MySQL 8.0, PostgreSQL 15, SQLite
- **Operating systems**: Ubuntu and Windows
- **Architecture**: amd64 and arm64

Tests include unit, integration and API contract tests with coverage reporting, performance regression benchmarks and an automated OWASP ZAP scan.

### Security Integration

`security.yml` performs dependency vulnerability checks with Snyk, static analysis using Bandit and Semgrep, container scanning with Trivy, infrastructure scanning with Checkov, license compliance validation and secret detection with GitLeaks.

### Deployment Automation

Staging and production deployments use a blue–green strategy. Images are built for multiple platforms with BuildKit and pushed to the configured registry. Kubernetes deployments perform health checks, API availability tests and notify Slack on success. Rollback is handled automatically by Kubernetes if health checks fail.

### Environment Management

- **Development** – feature branches trigger the CI workflow for early feedback.
- **Staging** – mirrors production and is used for integration and performance testing.
- **Production** – releases tagged with `v*.*.*` are deployed with monitoring and alerting hooks.

### Monitoring & Observability

Deployments integrate with existing monitoring solutions via Kubernetes annotations for APM, log aggregation and alerting. Deployment status and metrics are published to Slack.

### Disaster Recovery

Backups and rollbacks are managed through the Kubernetes deployment strategy. Database migrations support rollback and configuration files are version controlled so previous revisions can be restored quickly in the event of failure.

### Compliance Validation

Every deployment stage runs security and license checks. Results are stored as workflow artifacts for audit purposes and compliance reports can be generated from them.
